# Hand Gesture-Based Volume Control

Control your computer's audio volume using hand gestures with this Python project. This project uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyCAW to enable volume control based on the distance between your thumb and index finger.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- MediaPipe (`mediapipe`)
- PyCAW (`pycaw`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pycaw numpy

*Usage

Connect a webcam to your computer.
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-gesture-volume-control.git

Navigate to the project directory:
bash

cd hand-gesture-volume-control

Run the Python script:
bash

python volume_control.py

A window will open displaying the webcam feed with hand landmarks. Make the following hand gesture to control the volume:

Move your thumb and index finger closer together to decrease the volume.
Move your thumb and index finger farther apart to increase the volume.
Press the Esc key to exit the program.

Customization
You can customize the gesture recognition logic by modifying the code in the volume_control.py script. For example, you can adjust the distance thresholds for volume control by changing the values in the np.interp() function.

python
Copy code
# Convert the distance to a volume level
vol = np.interp(distance, [0.0, 0.6], [minVol, maxVol])  # Adjust the values based on your distance range
